<p>The <code>iffitoR</code>-package exists to fascilitate the import of data stored in the iffi-database (Inventario dei Fenomeni Franosi in Italia) into R. This includes the calculation of the unique “iffi”-codex in the dabases. The joins within the non-spatial databases and the subsequent join to a shapefile.</p>
<p>The shapefile as well as the non-spatial data both in the end contain a column that holds the unique identifier for each mass movement. The so called iffi-kodex. Here we give a short introdcution to the package and how to query the data from the databases.</p>
<p>As the format of the iffi-database is likely to change at some point in the near future, the code here is far from beeing good. Still, it hopefully does what it is supposed to do.</p>

<p>The idea is, that there are three important files each time the <code>make_shapefile</code> gets called</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A shapefile</strong> (either of the points or polygons containing a column called <code>PIFF_ID</code>)</li>
<li>
<strong>A database where each row represents an observed mass movement</strong> (<em>attribute database</em>)</li>
<li>
<strong>A database with additional information</strong> (<em>dictionary database</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In the <code>attri</code>-argument we pass a vector of the columns that are already in the <em>attribute_database</em> and don’t need any join to the dictionary database</p></li>
